# Iris Dataset Visualization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for visualizing key statistics and distributions of the Iris dataset. The visualizations help to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different features.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Four features were measured from each sample: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Visualizations

The notebook includes the following visualizations:

1. **Histograms**: Show the frequency distribution of individual features.
2. **Boxplots**: Provide a summary of the distribution of features and highlight outliers.
3. **Violin Plots**: Combine aspects of boxplots and density plots to show the distribution of data across different species.
4. **Pairplot with KDE**: Display bivariate relationships and distributions with Kernel Density Estimate (KDE).
5. **Correlation Heatmap**: Highlight the relationships between features.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Iris_Dataset_Visualization.git
    cd Iris_Dataset_Visualization
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Iris_Dataset_Visualization.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the notebook cells to generate the visualizations and explore the dataset.
